Emu readme
=============
Emu is UAARG's latest ground station imaging software. It is based on 
the old ground station software - pigeon 

Emu is used to:
- Monitor drone status.
- Send commands.
- Display maps and images.
- Log messages.
- Create an SSH connection with the onboard computer.

Emu does this through a combination of manual and
automatic processes. The ultimate objective is to offer a view into 
the drone's operations.
